Close to getting it to work but I've been facing multiple issues with the connection.
There couldn't be any connection because it keeps saying that the datasource 'url' isn't specified even though it's specified in application.properties. The other MySQL lab works fine, spring-mysql, I can get it connected to MySQL and everything works how it's supposed to but when it comes to implementing it to our project we get this error.
