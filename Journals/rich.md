## Week 2 Implement KONG 11/08/2021 - 11-15/2021
I started on the implementation of KONG for the database and middleware requirements

### Accomplishments:
- Started working on KONG for the database and middleware requirement

### Challenges:
- Encountered difficulty in implementing KONG into project website so I had to reference Lab 8
- Previous KONG implementation done in Lab 8 did not fully work within project implementation

- Since there were a couple bugs, I had to make several attempts at doing the KONG API Gateway
